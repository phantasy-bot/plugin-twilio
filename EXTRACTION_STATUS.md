## Meaning

This repo now receives a true source extraction payload from the main Phantasy monorepo. It should continue severing deep internal dependencies until the standalone repo becomes fully independent.

## Next Step

Continue replacing remaining monorepo-coupled imports with stable public package contracts, then publish from this repo directly.
